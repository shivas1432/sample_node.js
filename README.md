### About this project

> **Note:**  
> This project is primarily created for **practicing purposes**. I created this as my first Node.js application to explore and practice various concepts in Node.js, Express, and API integration.  
> While coding, I used this project as a playground to test new features and experiment with functionality before adding them to my main projects. Once I was satisfied with the functionality and implementation, I moved the relevant code to my desired project.
